        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li><br>
          <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li><br>
          <li>The <b>*</b> symbol on the css file indicates that all elements will have that value in the curly brackets.</li><br>
          <li>In css, separating the <b><i>selectors</i></b> *header , footer , ect.* with a comma will allow the declerations to affect all selectors implied.<br>
          This will help in keeping lines of code to a minimum, AKA DRY code.<br>(Do Not Repeat Yourself) code &#128513</li><br>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The reason you place the <b><i>script</i></b> element near the bottom of the HTML file is that the browser reads code in the order it appears in the file.
              If the JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect the HTML that hasn't loaded yet, there could be problems.<br>
              Placing JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page is one way to accommodate this dependency.</li><br>
          <li><b><i>Variables</i></b><br>
                Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable: let sum = 87;<br>
          <br><li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends.</li><br>
          <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/your-guide-to-semicolons-in-javascript/" target="_blank"><span>Guideline for JS. semicolons</span></a></li><br>
          <li><b><i>String</i></b>This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks.</li><br>
            <li><b><i>Number</i></b>This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.</li><br>
            <li><b><i>Booolean</i></b>	This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li><br>
            <li><b><i>Arry</i></b> This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li><br>
            <li><b><i>Object</i></b> This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.</li><br>
            <li><b><i>Strict Equality: ===,</i></b> This performs a test to see if two values are equal. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.</li><br>
            <li><b><i>Not,Dose-not-equal: !, !==,</i></b> This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false, etc..<br>
               When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal.</li><br>
            <li><b><i>Return</i></b>statement tells the browser to return the result variable out of the function so it is available to use.</li><br>
            <li><b><i>Events</i></b><br>Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser,<br>
                 and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse</li><br>
            <li><b><i>consel.log</i></b> right click the wep page anywhere and select inspect or use the kebord commands CTRL+SHIFT+I, this will bring up a new window.<br>
                at the bottum will be consle then select it. This is where your log will show.</li><br>
            <li><b><i>Contorl Flow</i></b> is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript,<br>
                   code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page, ORDER counts.</li><br>
            <li><b><i>Arrays</i></b> An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li><br>
            <li><b><i>For Loop</i></b> The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1</li><br>
